## Single-charge rule when the 60 minute interval is broken by midnight
Let's assume following rates in a hypotetical city (all times are subject to tax)

| Time        | Amount |
| ----------- | :----: |
| 00:00–13:00 | SEK 8  |
| 13:00–00:00 | SEK 13 |

And two events
- 2013-10-03 23:45
- 2013-10-04 00:15

Is it correct to charge total of 13 SEK? If so, should the tax apply to the first day or the second? (In cases when the maximum daily tax is reached for the first day, the total tax depends on this decision.)
